1
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:07,874
As you can see I have progressed to HR4.

2
00:00:07,874 --> 00:00:11,560
But quests are not cleared and Urgent does not show up.

3
00:00:13,749 --> 00:00:15,749
To fix it we will use FlagCalc tool. Link in description.

4
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,749
In HR1 there are 3 quests so I enter 3.

5
00:00:17,749 --> 00:00:19,749
Check box if you have next HR unlocked.

6
00:00:22,548 --> 00:00:24,548
In HR2 there are 4 quests.

7
00:00:24,549 --> 00:00:26,039
So type in 4.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,040
Check box.

9
00:00:30,176 --> 00:00:34,274
I will repeat it for every HR tab untill i reach the end.

10
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:41,867
I don't check the box in HR4, because HR5 isn't unlocked

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,750
Press Calculate.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,000
Use one of buttons under. I'll use second for Chakratos Manager.

13
00:00:53,663 --> 00:00:55,663
Just in case I will quit the game.

14
00:00:59,499 --> 00:01:03,511
Paste result here and click floppy icon (save).

15
00:01:15,717 --> 00:01:18,742
Starting game again to see if it works.

16
00:02:29,771 --> 00:02:31,771
Greeted by wall of text.

17
00:02:33,167 --> 00:02:35,167
It's a good sign.

18
00:02:37,621 --> 00:02:39,621
And here it is. My Urgent for HR5.

19
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:45,172
Quests are cleared to the point I have set in calc.

20
00:02:47,993 --> 00:02:49,993
That's it. Hope it will help you.
